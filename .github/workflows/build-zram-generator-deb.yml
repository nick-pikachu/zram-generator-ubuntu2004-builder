# .github/workflows/build-zram-generator-deb.yml
# This workflow compiles the upstream systemd-zram-generator C project
# and packages it into a .deb file specifically for Ubuntu 20.04.
# It uses a newer GitHub Actions runner (ubuntu-latest) but performs the build
# inside a Docker container running Ubuntu 20.04 to ensure compatibility.
